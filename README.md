# Treehopper-Ontogeny

The Morphometric Analyses File contains the script and data files used to compare share differences across 6 morphologically distinct treehopper species. 
The Folder contains the script, Final Allometry Analysis for Submission, which contains all of the code used to analyze the 2D landmark based geometric morphometric data.
All tps (raw landmark points) and csv files (classifiers) contained in the folder are needed to run the code properly. 

The Repeatability Analysis File contains the script and data used to determine the amount of human error and positional error introduced into the dataset.

Please reach out to me if you run into any problems with the scripts or data files --> anna.kudla@duke.edu OR anna.m.kudla@gmail.com
